### Insights from SVB: A Financial Post-Mortem üíºüìä

#### Project Description:
Utilized Python üêç and TensorFlow üß† for advanced statistical modeling, analyzing SVB Bank's financial data to identify key factors contributing to its failure. 

#### Achievements:
- Recommended strategic actions to mitigate operational risks, potentially saving 6% üí∞ in annual costs.
- Developed Power BI üìä dashboards for clear data visualization and informed decision-making.

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of SVB Bank's financial data using Python and TensorFlow. By leveraging advanced statistical modeling techniques, I identified critical factors contributing to the bank's failure, which included operational inefficiencies and inadequate risk management practices.

The insights gained from this analysis led to actionable recommendations aimed at helping other banks avoid similar pitfalls. By focusing on strengthening risk management, enhancing regulatory compliance, and optimizing operational efficiency, financial institutions can improve their resilience and sustainability in a competitive market environment.

The development of Power BI dashboards further facilitated clear data visualization, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time insights derived from complex financial data sets.

This project underscores my expertise in statistical modeling, data analysis, and strategic advisory, demonstrating my ability to provide valuable recommendations for optimizing financial performance and mitigating risks in the banking sector.
The integration of Power BI dashboards further facilitated clear and insightful data visualization, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the analysis findings.

This project showcases my proficiency in statistical modeling, data analysis, and strategic advisory, highlighting my ability to derive actionable insights from complex financial data sets.

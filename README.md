In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of SVB Bank's financial data using Python and TensorFlow. By leveraging advanced statistical modeling techniques, I identified critical factors contributing to the bank's failure, which included operational inefficiencies and inadequate risk management practices.

The insights gained from this analysis led to actionable recommendations aimed at helping other banks avoid similar pitfalls. By focusing on strengthening risk management, enhancing regulatory compliance, and optimizing operational efficiency, financial institutions can improve their resilience and sustainability in a competitive market environment.

The development of Power BI dashboards further facilitated clear data visualization, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time insights derived from complex financial data sets.
